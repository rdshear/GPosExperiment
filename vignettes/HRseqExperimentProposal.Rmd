| *This document is a draft proposal for an extension to the `SummarizedExperiment` package.*
| *All the R names in this draft document are preliminary. Suggestions for alternative names are welcome. Consequently, the names are subject to change without notice.*

| We have changed the name of the package from `GPosExperiment` to `HRseqExperiment`. In either case, the purpose of this package is to make it convenient to process data addressed by genomic coordinate at nucleotide resolution. The `GPos` class in the `GenomicRanges` package is specifically designed to make the processing of just this type of data efficient. But the name is only meaningful from the software developer's point of view. We coin the term "HRseq" for high resolution sequencing, to include assays that  [h]{.underline}igh [r]{.underline}esolution seqence data.

# Introduction

The `HRseqExperiment` package is an extension of `RangedSummarizedExperiment` that facilitates convenient management of experimental genomic data.

`RangedSummarizedExperiment` stores assay as matrices, which are easy to use when each each matrix element is scalar. But when each observation consists of a vector of values, the manipulation and visualization of the data can become cumbersome.

`HRseqExperiment` addresses this obsticle by providing convenient capabilities for storing, retrieving and manipulating with the same style and convenience as scalar assays.

While there are minimal syntactic extensions to `RangedSummarizedExperiment`, the class internals need to take account of performance and memory requirements for real world applications.

# The `HResExperiment` Package

## Usage

The essential mechanism of `HResExperiment` is the creation of an `HRseqAssay` object, which associates the genomically indexed observations with each sample and specifies processing options. These observations are passed to `HRseqAssay` either as a `GRangesList` or as a list of filenames of genomic files that correspond to the samples. In either case, the name for each list element must match a sample identifier (`colName` value).

The parent virtual class `SummarizedExperiemnt::Assays` consists of a `SimpleList` that points to `matrix` objects, each of which is an assay. In `HResExperiment`, the setter functions `assays<-` and `assay<-` will also accept an `HRseqAssay` object.

### HRseqAssay Constructor

```         
HRseqAssay(x = GRangesList(), 
  seqFilenameList = NULL, 
  strand.aware = FALSE, 
  zero.fill = FALSE, 
  mcol.name = "score", 
  value.type = numeric)
```

#### x - `GrangesList`

Each `GRanges` list element is the assay readout for a specific sample. The name of each list element must correspond to the name of a sample. If `seqinfo` is present, it must match the value of seqinfo of any `HRseqAssay` to which it is assigned. If present, the `seqFilenameList` parameter must be null.

#### seqFilenameList

An alternative to the first constructor argument, for loading `GRanges` objects from files. A list of fully qualified filenames, each of which can be read by `rtracklayer` to produce a `GRanges` object. For strand-specific assays encoded in formats that do not report strand, such as bedGraph, the list element will contain a character vector of two filenames, each identified by their strand, viz.

```         
fnl <- list(Sample12 = 
  c('+'='/n/lab12/sample12-netseq-pos.bedgraph', 
    '-'='/n/lab12/sample12-netseq-neg.bedgraph'))

print(fnl[["Sample12"]]['+'])
                                      + 
"/n/lab12/sample12-netseq-pos.bedgraph" 
```

#### strand.aware

`logical`. See [strand.aware].

#### zero.fill

`logical`. See [zero.fill].

#### mcol.name

Where the GRanges objects have more than one `mcol`, the name of the `mcol` that holds the assay values.

#### value.type

The data type to be returned for each element when retrieving the value. Accepted values are logical, integer, numeric, double, character, factor, GRanges, and Rle.

### The `Assay()<-` Extension

`assay(x, i) <- HRseqAssay(â€¦)`

There is no change to the syntax of the `assay` setter function. While the `HRSeqAssay` object is not a matrix-like object, when associated with an `HRExperiment` object, it is capable of generating a matrix-like object that conforms to the requirements of assay.

### assay() Extension

```         
assay(hse, i = 1, formula = ., return.type = NULL, strand.aware = NULL)
```

#### hse

A `HResExperiment` object.

#### i

The assay number or name.

#### formula

If present, a formula that operates on each matrix element seperately.

#### return type

Override to the default return type declared in `HRSeqAssay`.

#### strand.aware

Override to `HRSeqAssay`.
